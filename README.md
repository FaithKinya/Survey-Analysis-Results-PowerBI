# Survey Analysis
This is simple project to build a dashboard using powerbi.

The dataset used was a professinal_survey.xlsx which contains data collected form from different professionals in different places to derive insights in their professional lives e.g their average salries, happiness with their work/life balance etc.
I used powerbi to visualize some of the insights derived and which include:
  - Average ages of survey takers
  - Average salaries per job title
  - The employees favorite programming languages
  - The number of people that took surveys by where they come from.
